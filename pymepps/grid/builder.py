        Class representing horizontal grids of grid based files. This class is
        based on the grid description files of cdo [cdo]_. With this grid
        description is is possible to remap grid based arrays and to interpolate
        for a given latitude and longitude. Internally the grids are transformed
        to latitude and longitude points.

        Parameters
        ----------
        griddes : str or dict(str, str/float)
            The grid description. This could be a path to a cdo conform grid
            description file. Another possibility is to use a cdo conform grid
            description within a str or a dict. The latitude and longitude
            values are calculated based on this parameter.
        
        Attributes

        Method to clean the given grid str and to get a python dict.
        Key and value are separated with =. Every new key value pair needs a new
        line delimiter. Only alphanumeric characters are allowed as key and
        value. To delimit a value list use spaces and new lines. Lines with #
        are used as comment lines.
        
        Steps to decode the grid string:
            1) String splitting by new line delimiter
            2) Clean the lines from unallowed characters
            3) Split the non-comment lines to key, value pairs
            4) Append elements where no key, value pair is available to the
               previous value

            6) Convert the values to float numbers

        ----------
        grid_str : str or list(str)
            The given grid_str which should be decoded. If this is a string the
            string will be splitten by new line into a list. It is necessary
            that every list entry has only one key = value entry.
