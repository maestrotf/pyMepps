    """
    A simplified way to load weather model data into a SpatialDataset.
    Technically this class is a helper and wrapper around the file handlers and
    SpatialDataset.
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    data_path: str
        The path to the files. This path could have a glob-conform path pattern.
        Every file found within this pattern will be used to determine the file
        type and to generate the SpatialDataset.
    file_type: str or None, optional
        The file type determines which file handler will be used to load the
        data. If the file type is None it will be determined automatically based
        on given files. All the files with the majority file type will be used 
        to generate the SpatialDataset.
    grid : str or Grid or None, optional
        The grid describes the horizontal grid of the spatial data. The given 
        grid will be forwarded to the given SpatialDataset instance. Default is
        None.
