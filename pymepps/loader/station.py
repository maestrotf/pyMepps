class StationLoader(BaseLoader):
    """
    A simplified way to load station data into a TSDataset.
    Technically this class is a helper and wrapper around the file handlers and
    TSData.

    Parameters
    ----------
    data_path: str
        The path to the files. This path could have a glob-conform path pattern.
        Every file found within this pattern will be used to determine the file
        type and to generate the TSDataset.
    file_type: str or None, optional
        The file type determines which file handler will be used to load the
        data. If the file type is None it will be determined automatically based
        on given files. All the files with the majority file type will be used 
        to generate the TSDataset. The available file_types are:
            nc: NetCDF files
            wm: Text files in a specific "Wettermast format"
    lonlat: tuple(float, float), optional
        The lonlat coordinate tuple describes the position of the station in
        degrees. If this is None the position is unknown. Default is None.
