class Model(object):
    """
    This is a base class for all statistical modules of pymepps.
    
    Attributes
    ----------
    state:
        The state of the statistical model. This state could be a dict with 
        SpatialData and TSData instances or a fitted model. If the state is None
        the model has no state.
    
    Methods
    -------
    fit:
        The fit method is used for an initial fit of the statistical model. 
        The initial fit could be e.g. used to set the initial state of the
        model.
    predict:
        The predict method is used to get predict with the saved state and the 
        given data new instances.
    transform:
        Transform refers to predict. This method should be used if it is not 
        natural to make a predict with the statistical model, e.g. this could be
        used for a metric.
    save:
        The save method is used to save the statistical model in a persistent
        manner. With an external load function a statistical model could be
        load. Normally the statistical model will be pickled.
