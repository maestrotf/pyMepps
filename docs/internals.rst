wettermast.nc
^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The wettermast.nc is extracted from original
`Wettermast Hamburg wettermast.uni-hamburg.de`_ data. We get the permission of
Ingo Lange to use the data in a sliced manner.

We extracted the data from the original NetCDF-file and sliced a time period of
5 days and used only the 2 metre temperature.
